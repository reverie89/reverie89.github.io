This one is my hobby project, launch vtsuki.net with Flash animation, got interactive features and portfolio page, quite shiok.

- Try to make vtsuki.net website using old school Macromedia Flash and ActionScript
- Got animated loading bar when open index to look pro
- Bottom is real-time clock, opening got background sound (about 4 seconds), top menu all clickable links, can navigate around one
