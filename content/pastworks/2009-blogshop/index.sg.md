Freelance project to build blogshop, custom design, got admin portal and order management, all use PHP and MySQL.

- Use PHP 5/MySQL5 stack, client give the design inspired by blogshops, I just follow
- Slice PSD to make the website
- Also made a basic Admin portal so client can go in edit content and check mailing list, everything easy
- Ordering Form work like Contact Form, will email client about order info and they can follow up over email
