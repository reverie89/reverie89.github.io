This project involved setting up a game forum and related infrastructure, but was discontinued due to time constraints and lack of visibility.

- Forum for games such as Natural Selection 2, Team Fortress 2. Also initially planned to host private game servers. Whole project never actually took off because I was too busy with other matters and neglected the maintenance and the visibility of the website
- Purchased the domain name, hosted the forum website under one of my Virtual Private Servers (VPS), connected domain to Outlook third-party email service, managed the server administration, firewall security, etc
