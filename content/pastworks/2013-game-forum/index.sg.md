This project try to setup game forum and all the backend, but stop halfway because not worth the effort.

- Forum for games like Natural Selection 2, Team Fortress 2, even plan to host private game server, but too busy, never maintain, website also not much people visit
- Buy domain name, host forum on my VPS, connect domain to Outlook email, do all the server admin and firewall, everything ownself settle
