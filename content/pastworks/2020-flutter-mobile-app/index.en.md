This project involved learning Flutter and building a front-end mobile app for product traceability and service installation. The app demonstrates key features and can be extended to connect to NoSQL databases like Firebase.

- Managed and oversaw the development of a corporate mobile app for product traceability and service installation
- Learned Flutter v1.17 on YouTube and built my own inspired version instead. Has no reference to the corporate mobile app (which was built on React Native, which is different from my Dart codebase)
- Coded the front-end only. With some code changes, this should connect fairly easily to a NoSQL DB e.g. Firebase
