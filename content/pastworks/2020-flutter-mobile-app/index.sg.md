This project learn Flutter and build front-end mobile app for product traceability and service installation. Got demo features, can extend to connect NoSQL DB like Firebase.

- Manage and oversee corporate mobile app for product traceability and service installation
- Learn Flutter v1.17 from YouTube, build my own version, not same as company app (company use React Native, mine is Dart)
- Only code front-end, if want can connect to NoSQL DB like Firebase, just change code a bit
