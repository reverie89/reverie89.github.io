This project features an automated hydroponic watering system powered by an ESP32 microcontroller. It intelligently checks water levels before mixing nutrients to precise concentrations. The system uses a single 12V supply for pumps, with voltage conversion for microcontroller and sensors, ensuring efficient and reliable operation for home hydroponics.

- Automated watering system
- Checks for sufficient water before attempting to mix in nutrients to required concentration levels
- Powered by a single 12V power supply, for water pump and peristaltic pumps, with buck conversions down to 5V for the microcontroller and 3.3V for sensor inputs.
