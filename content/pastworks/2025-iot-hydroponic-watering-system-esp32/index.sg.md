This project is automated hydroponic watering system using ESP32, smart enough to check water level before mixing nutrients. Use one 12V power supply for all pumps, convert voltage for microcontroller and sensors, very efficient for home hydroponics.

- Automated watering system, no need manual
- Check water level before mix nutrients to right concentration
- Use single 12V power supply for water pump and peristaltic pumps, buck convert to 5V for microcontroller, 3.3V for sensors
