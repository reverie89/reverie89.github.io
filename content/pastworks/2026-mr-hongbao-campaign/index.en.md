This was a partnership with the [2026 Museum Roundtable (MR) Lunar New Year Hongbao Campaign](https://www.nhb.gov.sg/what-we-do/our-work/sector-development/museum-roundtable/2026-museum-roundtable-lunar-new-year-hongbao-campaign) to launch a treasure-hunting type of game titled Hongbao Hunt. It is a gamified digital experience for the public to play at Six (6) participating museums and heritage institutions to collect the Lunar New Year Red Packets. The event runs for One (1) month from 23 January 2026 to 15 February 2026. Participants log into the web game via their Singpass, scan the artefact by solving a riddle and collect their prize at the designated vending machines located in the museums. Public feedback was positive and prizes at several museums were mostly redeemed by the first weekend.
