It is a gamified digital experience for the public to play at Six (6) participating museums and heritage institutions to collect the Lunar New Year Red Packets. The event runs for One (1) month from 23 January 2026 to 15 February 2026. Participants log into the web game via their Singpass, scan the artefact by solving a riddle and collect their prize at the designated vending machines located in the museums. Public feedback was positive and prizes at several museums were mostly redeemed by the first weekend.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vtsuki.net revamp</title><link>https://reverie89.github.io/pastworks/2025-vtsuki-revamp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reverie89.github.io/pastworks/2025-vtsuki-revamp/</guid><description>&lt;p>vtsuki.net is rebuit and now powered by Hugo and agentic AI prompts.

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Immich is a self-hosted photo and video backup solution&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Create swapfile for more memory on non-critical applications (because I am too stingy to pay money to add RAM)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All web services are HTTPS with LetsEncrypt and renewed automatically. DNS is proxied through Cloudflare&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Services which do not need exposure to internet are served within Docker network i.e. only 1 port (HTTP) is exposed, the rest are reverse proxied with Caddy&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Forum for games such as Natural Selection 2, Team Fortress 2. Also initially planned to host private game servers. Whole project never actually took off because I was too busy with other matters and neglected the maintenance and the visibility of the website&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purchased the domain name, hosted the forum website under one of my Virtual Private Servers (VPS), connected domain to Outlook third-party email service, managed the server administration, firewall security, etc&lt;/li>
