It intelligently checks water levels before mixing nutrients to precise concentrations. The system uses a single 12V supply for pumps, with voltage conversion for microcontroller and sensors, ensuring efficient and reliable operation for home hydroponics.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Automated watering system&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Checks for sufficient water before attempting to mix in nutrients to required concentration levels&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Powered by a single 12V power supply, for water pump and peristaltic pumps, with buck conversions down to 5V for the microcontroller and 3.3V for sensor inputs.&lt;/li>

Using AI-assisted coding, a Python script was developed to update sidecar files with accurate durations, successfully correcting hundreds of records.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Immich is a self-hosted photo and video backup solution&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There seemed to be a bug where the video duration length on preview is not displayed correctly on the app&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reported the issue around v1.91.4, still present in v1.93.3&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The problem probably affected a small number of users only and after investigation, it was actually an easy (but tedious) fix&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Used CodeGPT Plus to write a Python script to fix the issue&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Script looks into directories recursively for video files, uses ffprobe to get duration, and updates sidecar files (*.xmp)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tested and updated 776 records successfully&lt;/li>

Storage and memory were optimized for cost efficiency. Internal services were isolated within a Docker network, and a personal profile was added to the site. The setup improved reliability, security, and maintainability for all web services.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Add another VPS instance. 1 for web server, another for hobby/Docker 19.03 fun&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mount additional storage volume to VPS #2&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create swapfile for more memory on non-critical applications (because I am too stingy to pay money to add RAM)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All web services are HTTPS with LetsEncrypt and renewed automatically. DNS is proxied through Cloudflare&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Services which do not need exposure to internet are served within Docker network i.e. only 1 port (HTTP) is exposed, the rest are reverse proxied with Caddy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Created personal profile on vtsuki.net&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Created a bat file to simplify management of Windows Firewall for blocking ports and whitelisting IPv4 addresses for PC game Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Features such as CEO missions and Biker businesses can only be played in an online session with other players. This can be disruptive especially when there are cheaters (modders) in the game and you want to play your game in peace&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no modification to the underlying game and in fact just stops certain outbound traffic that the game uses to connect to other online sessions and allows specific IPv4 addresses (such as your friend&amp;rsquo;s) to connect to your &amp;ldquo;private&amp;rdquo; online session&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Forum for games such as Natural Selection 2, Team Fortress 2. Also initially planned to host private game servers. Whole project never actually took off because I was too busy with other matters and neglected the maintenance and the visibility of the website&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purchased the domain name, hosted the forum website under one of my Virtual Private Servers (VPS), connected domain to Outlook third-party email service, managed the server administration, firewall security, etc&lt;/li>
